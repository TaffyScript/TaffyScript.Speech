# TaffyScript.Speech
This library implements a TaffyScript wrapper around certain objects in the System.Speech library. Specifically this library wraps the [SpeechRecognitionEngine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.speech.recognition.speechrecognitionengine?view=netframework-4.7.1), [SpeechSynthesizer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.speech.synthesis.speechsynthesizer?view=netframework-4.7.1), and [GrammarBuilder](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.speech.recognition.grammarbuilder?view=netframework-4.7.1) objects.

# Examples
You can find examples of the SpeechRecognizer and SpeechSynthesis objects in [this](https://github.com/TaffyScript/TaffyScript.Speech/blob/master/Tests/program.tfs) file, which is in the Tests folder.
